"Varnir, son of the dead King Regar of the Crimsonwing Drakes, insists that "
"Regar promised the throne to him.  Through fighting at Feralon's side, "

"It is said that the eldest lines of drakes - the direct descendants of the "
"dragons themselves - have veins which course with fire rather than blood. "
"That they can breathe fire as they do lends credence to this belief, though, "
