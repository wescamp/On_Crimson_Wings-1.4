#textdomain wesnoth-On_Crimson_Wings

## Needs: improved dialogue; balancing (esp. easy/hard); improved music selection
##        Could use a custom forest tile or two for "corrupted forest"
##        Corrupted woses could use better graphics, especially ice breath animation (looks more like they're throwing ice);
##        Also, death animations haven't been updated, but this is a fairly low priority
##        Custom portraits for the two shamans would be cool.  Again, actual story images/journey map could be good.
##        Torr has no portrait at all (outlaws lack one atm) and would like one.  Jula doesn't really need one.
##        Use loyal_icon from Dead Waters?
##        Map graphics could be improved in general - add scenery & items

## Name notes: hero = Feralon; rival = Varnir; advisor = Galgor; friend = Karath Kor; dead king = Regar; sister = Demla Ka
##             shamans = Laviniel and Celondë
